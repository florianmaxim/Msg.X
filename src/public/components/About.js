        <p>
            A jungle is land covered with dense vegetation dominated by trees. Application of the term has varied greatly during the last several centuries. Prior to the 1970s, tropical rainforests were generally referred to as jungles but this terminology has fallen out of usage. Jungles in Western literature can represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation: attributed to the jungle's association in colonial discourse with places colonised by Europeans.
